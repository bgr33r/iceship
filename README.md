This code is a working repo of a CNN classifier I am designing for the Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge on Kaggle. It is a work in progress, and I am using this repo to both store code, and act as a sounding board for other folks interested in either the competition of the methods. I have adapted code originally posted from https://www.kaggle.com/sinkie/keras-data-augmentation-with-multiple-inputs, though as I have been working our code and methodologies are diverging.
